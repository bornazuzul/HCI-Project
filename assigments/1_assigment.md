# 💛 VolunMe – Turning Free Time into Meaningful Action
## 1. The Problem

Many people have free time that they don’t use in a productive or meaningful way.
Instead of spending hours on social media, watching TV, or playing games, that time could be used to help others and contribute to the community.

However, there is no simple, centralized, and accessible platform that connects people who want to volunteer with local events and organizations that need help.
This results in a missed opportunity for both sides — those who want to do good, and those who need support.

## 4. How the Idea Was Created

The idea emerged during a brainstorming session between me and my colleague.
We noticed that many people have plenty of free time, but often don’t use it in the best way.

We asked ourselves — instead of spending hours playing games or scrolling on social media, why not help organize a local sports event or plant trees in a burned area?

That simple thought led to the creation of VolunMe — a platform designed to transform free time into good deeds, connection, and purpose.
